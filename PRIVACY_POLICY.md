# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 2025

## Introduction

Dashboard New Tab is a simple browser extension that replaces your new tab page with a customizable dashboard. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Storage

**All data stays on your device.** Dashboard New Tab stores all information locally using your browser's storage. We do not collect, transmit, or store any data on external servers.

### What is stored locally:
- Dashboard configuration (widget positions, sizes, settings)
- Widget data (bookmarks, calendar preferences, API endpoints you configure)
- Theme preferences (light/dark mode)
- Custom widget names and configurations

## Third-Party Services

Dashboard New Tab may connect to services that you configure:
- **Google Calendar**: If you use the Google Calendar widget, authentication is handled directly by Google. We do not store your Google credentials.
- **Firefly III, YouTrack, Tasktrove, Weather APIs**: If you configure these widgets, you provide your own API endpoints and tokens. This data is stored locally and only sent to the services you configure.

**Important**: We have no access to any data sent to or received from these services. All API credentials are stored locally on your device.

## Permissions

- **Storage**: To save your dashboard settings locally
- **Tabs**: To replace the default new tab page
- **Identity**: To authenticate with Google Calendar (only if you use that widget)
- **Host Permissions**: To fetch data from the APIs you configure

## Your Data

- **Access**: All data is stored locally in your browser
- **Delete**: Uninstall the extension to remove all data
- **Export**: Use the export feature to download your configuration
- **No Account**: We don't require or create any user accounts
